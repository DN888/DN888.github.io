<!--
Maybe needs a Ranking list on the website.  Energy Detto is the strongest and rarest species.  When you start out you can choose what type of Master you want to be.  Choices will be: Control, Attack, Defend, admin and etc.  Only control masters can merge dettos.  Admin masters are chosen once every half year, and they have special control over servers(will be mostly people I know.)

Line 48 or around 48 needs revising

<a name="FAQ"></a><h1>Detto FAQ(Created by SRM) (Sphinx the Riddle Master.) (DCnation***@gmail.com)</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>What do you do in the game?  A: What you basicly do in this game, so far is battle in singleplayer worlds and collect treasure dropped by the defeated Dettos or bosses.  You can level up to different levels to gain higher stats.  Moves found in defeated Detto's can last for either 2-4 uses before breaking.  When you level up to a certain level you can evolve into a better Detto with a wider variety of moves that can be learned(Appearenes also will change.).  More advanced Dettos can either be purchased, or found in special events that have a low percantage chance of dropping it's egg(hatched Detto's level can range from 1-8).  Evo-Stones can be used to evolve your Detto into a different branch e.i. Water into Ice, or Air into Rust.  Each branch has It's own types of abilities and moves that can be used for it, so choose wisely!</li>
		<li>Are there going to be any more updates? A:Yes, there is going to be constant updates and we will keep trying our best to keep this wonderful server running. </li>
		<li>What other features are you thinking of for big updates?  A: I am thinking about adding a chat and multiplayer room, so players can battle each other and avoid being bored by just playing CPUs.  I am also thinking of more evolutions, not just stopping at 2 or 3, but maybe 4 or 5, but we will see.</li>
		<li>Are there going to be any special events or items that I can get for a limited amount of time?  A: Yes, there may be exclusive Detto's that will come with events and there may be constumes like Reindeer horns for special kinds of Detto's.  There may be also some exclusive moves like during Thankgiving, Horn of Plenty that heals you or maybe Flock, and etc.
		<li>Q: Can items and other things be bought with real money?  A: Yes, but be sure you want that item or Detto, because there are no refunds.</li>
