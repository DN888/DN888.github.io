Clash Royale Decks For Use
</title>
<head> Welcome!</head>
<p>
<h2>Disclaimer: These decks are only for arena 1-5 uses, I can't garuntee a win for these decks, but you can try them out.</h2>

<h3>
 
1.: A. Giant B. Bomber C. Musketeer D. Minions E. Cannon F. Fireball G. Valkerie H. goblins
 
</h3>
</p>
<p>
 
<h4>Deck Average Elixer Cost: 3.5</h4>
 
 
Explanation: Some things that I put were fairly obvious, so unless you just started, you will have no trouble understanding me.  I put the giant in for two reasons, one, it's a tank and can be used to cover for weaker troops(Minions, goblins, etc.)  and two, the giant at the end of the game can serve as a great defense system.  Perhaps with 5 seconds left one of your towers has 22 health left, but your opponents have a minion horde coming in.  So, you just place down a giant and Voila, the minions are distracted and your tower is protected from the horde. 

</p>
<p>
I put the bomber in for one reason, don't you hate it when you put down a giant or tank and get swarmed with goblins, skeletons, tombstones, skelly army and etc?  Then put down a bomber behind your tank.  It protects it from weak troops that swarm you.  (Although this could backfire when you bomber is hitting a tower, they don't get distracted.)
</p>
 <p>
The Musketeer will provide good enough damage if you place it behind your giant, its' weakness however is being attacked when distracted, the tank only shields from the front, but not the back, so most likely, they would place skeletons or goblin to counter with your musketeer. The Musketeer is also really good against the baby dragon and spear goblins.
 </p>
 
 
 <p>
Minions are crucial to defeating annoying troops like the Valkerie, Skelly Army, Hog Rider, and etc.  I would recommend placing it behind the giant or musketeer to kill the counter that your opponent might place.
 </p>
 
 
 <p>
When you are <i>this</i> close to getting to the next arena, someone uses a hog rider clutch win on you, you become fustrated, that's why you should have a cannon on hand to defend mostly against hog riders, but also I would say valkeries, giants and weak troops like spear goblins.  Although the giant if high enough level with reinforcements behind it will overcome  the cannon, so placing a valkerie somewhere close by would be maybe crow tower saving.    
 </p>
 
   
 
 <p>
I use fireball to defend against Barbarians, Witches, occasionally Valkeries and Mini Pekkas and minion hordes.  They are also dead useful when trying to defeat a low healthed tower.
 </p>
  
 	
 
   
 
<p> 	
Valkeries are very useful for being a part tank and doing splash damage, they are also very useful for defeating Giant skeletons, mass mini troops and witches.  Also, Valkeries should be saved for defense and pushing the occasiona attack, because your opponent might swarm you with skelly army or witch when your valkery just died.     
</p> 


<p> 
Use goblins for killing Musketeers, spear goblins, skeletons and giants, while placing them on offense behind a giant and minions may be helpful for if they run behind the giant or any other slow troops, they push them forward without slowing down.

<h3>2.a.Hog Rider b. Zap c. goblins d. Cannon e. valkerie f.fireball g. mini skeletons h. minions</h3>
<h4>
Deck Average Elixer: 2.8
</h4>
<p>
The Hog Rider is the main attacking factor in this deck, because it is fast, attacks fast, does decent damage, and only goes for towers or buildings.  The Hog Rider has some weaknesses including cannons, goblins, skellys, other buildings and witches, so that is why your zap is there.(Next sentence has the explanation for zap.)

</p>
Zap momentarily stuns a building allowing more time for your hog rider to get one more hit in.  Zap as mentioned before stuns a building, but does very little damage.  Zap actually is useful other than stunning buildings and doing little damage, it is very good at almost destroying minion hordes and finishing off the Skeleton Army.


<p>
Goblins in this deck are seen and used by placing behind the Hog Rider to do decent amount of damage on the tower and protecting the Hog Rider from skeletons or other troops.  Goblins are also sometimes used as a distraction for minion hordes to allow  your crown towers to pick them off.  And as said in the previous deck, the goblin is used to kill a variety of other cards.  However, goblins are easily defeated by air troops or a valkerie, so I would have your minions ready at hand too when placing down goblins.
</p>

<p>
The Cannon is put in here mainly for distracting valkeries when you don't have minions.  The Cannon is also placed down for defense against the Hog Rider and usually a distraction for the giant or balloon.  The Cannon however if placed at the edge of your territory, can be easily picked off by air troops, or a musketeer.(Spear Goblins won't work.)
