Explanation: Some things that I put were fairly obvious and this deck should be used for Barbarian Bowl and Pekka's Playhouse.  I put the giant in for two reasons, one, it's a tank and can be used to cover for weaker troops(Minions, goblins, etc.)  and two, the giant at the end of the game can serve as a great defense system.  Perhaps with 5 seconds left one of your towers has 22 health left, but your opponents have a minion horde coming in.  So, you just place down a giant and Voila, the minions are distracted and your tower is protected from the horde.  <b>Giant level recommendation: 5,6,7</b>

I put the bomber in for one reason, don't you hate it when you put down a giant or tank and get swarmed with goblins, skeletons, tombstones, skelly army and etc?  Then put down a bomber behind your tank.  It protects it from weak troops that swarm you.  (Although this could backfire when you bomber is hitting a tower, they don't get distracted.) <b>Recommended level usage: 4-8.</b>

<section>
The Musketeer will provide good enough damage if you place it behind your giant, its' weakness however is being attacked when distracted, the tank only shields from the front, but not the front.  Musketeer is also really good against the baby dragon and spear goblins.  <b>Recommended level of usage: 4,5,6,7.</b>

Minions are crucial to defeating annoying troops like the Valkerie, Skelly Army, Hog Rider, and etc.  <b>Recommended level of usage, 6,7,8.</b>

When you are <i>this</i> close to getting to the next arena, someone uses a hog rider clutch win on you, you become fustrated, that's why you should have a cannon on hand to defend mostly against hog riders, but also I would say valkeries, giants and weak troops. <b> Recommended Level usage: 7,8.</b>

<b>Next Troop Explanation:</b>

<section>
I use fireball to defend against Barbarians, Witches, occasionally Valkeries and Mini Pekkas and minion hordes.  They are also dead useful when trying to defeat a low healthed tower.

<b>Recommended usage level: 5,6.</b>

<section>
Valkeries are very useful for being a part tank and doing splash damage, they are also very useful for defeating Giant skeletons, mass mini troops and witches. <b> Recommended Level Usage: 5,6,7</b>
